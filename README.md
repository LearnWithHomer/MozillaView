MozillaView - GeckoView for Cordova
---

This is for pluggable webviews.  This is a POC and doesn't work.  Still figuring out licensing, it's either Apache or MPL, or both!

Installation:
1. Check out the pluggable_webview branch from this personal cordova repo:
https://github.com/infil00p/cordova-android/tree/pluggable_webview

2. Get Geckoview from Mozilla:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-android/

3. Update geckoview_assets in the sample project by unzipping geckoview_assets.zip in the project root.

4. Add both to Eclipse and link them to this project.
