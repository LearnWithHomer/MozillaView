MozillaView - GeckoView for Cordova
---

This is for pluggable webviews.  This is a POC and doesn't work.  Still figuring out licensing, it's either Apache or MPL, or both!

Installation:

1. Check out the 4.0.x branch from this Apache Cordova Android repo:
Github Mirror: https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/tree/4.0.x
Apache Repository: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cordova-android.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/4.0.x

2. Get Geckoview from Mozilla:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-android/

3. Update geckoview_assets in the sample project by unzipping geckoview_assets.zip in the project root.

4. Add both to Eclipse and link them to this project.
